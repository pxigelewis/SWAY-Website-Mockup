# SWAY-Website-Mockup


Website issues order of importance:

- figuring out the issue with importing the Tailwind custom colours and updating the background colour to trueGray 900
- importing our own photos to the site -- currently all uploaded images are from unspplash and I'm not able to update the logo at the top of the page
- taking a look at spacing in the code -- I used <br>'s to space out some of the sections (e.g., spacing after the stats section) but I'm not sure if there is a better was to do that/if using <br> will be reliable across platforms

Other minor tasks:

- determining what to do with the "trusted by... comapnies" section -- we dont have any to put here as of yet so should we remove it or keep it
- colour and image adjustments once we're able to get the custom colours working
